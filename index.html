					<h2>Rules are Toxic</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The Goal</h3>
					<p>We want to be productive.</p>
					<p>Google's large study investigated teamwork:</p>
					<p><a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/">re:Work</a>, aka Project Aristotle</p>
					<p>One factor dominates in predicting team performance:</p>
					<p><b>Psychological Safety</b></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Psychological Safety</h3>
					<p>Team members experience psychological safety when they are confident enough to,
					<ul>
						<li>Make mistakes</li>
						<li>Ask for help</li>
						<li>Raise tough issues</li>
						<li>Accept differences in others</li>
						<li>Trust coworkers to act in good faith</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Other Factors</h3>
					<p>Psychological safety is more effective than commonly opimized-for factors:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Experience Level</li>
						<li>Hours Worked</li>
						<li>Strong Team Identity (Monoculture)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Competitive workplaces are the past, Psychological Safety is the future.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Let's Set Some Rules</h3>
					<p>Programmers are accustomed to solving problems by making rules.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Code of Conduct - foster diversity, inhibit bullying</li>
						<li>Coding Standards - define clean code</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These are important documents to have, but do they solve the problem?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Bad Faith Actors</h3>
					<p>People acting in the best interest of the team don't need rules to tell them right from wrong.</p>
					<p>Bullies can be empowered by rules because loop-holes imply areas of permitted (but morally reprehensible) behaviour.</p>
					<p>Rules cannot stop people from acting in bad faith.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Scott Tucker</h3>
					<p>Professional race car driver, pay-day loan empire founder, poster boy for bad faith adherence to rules.</p>
					<p>Convicted of racketeering, 16 year prison sentence, $1.3B fine is the largest in FTC history.</p>
					<p>His legal defense: he believed that technically he was obeying the law.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Agile by Dictate</h3>
					<p>Mandatory stand-ups, code reviews, test coverage = productivity?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Forced communication becomes about insecurities and signalling rather than surfacing blockers.</li>
						<li>Token code reviews focus on cosmetic issues.</li>
						<li>Unit tests can achieve 100% coverage without validation of crucial behaviour.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Alternatives</h3>
					<p>Rules are often mistaken for,</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Guidelines - informative, educate</li>
						<li>Processes - prescriptive, absolve responsibility</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Rules are <b>punative</b>. They are not instructions in this context, but rather they assume bad intent and are useful when deciding how to assess penalties after the damage is done.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>"More" Illegal</h3>
					<p>A colleague expressed frustration about composting.</p>
					<p>"Failure to compost should be illegal in Vancouver."</p>
					<p>"But it is. One could be fined for that."</p>
					<p>Exasperated that the problem is occurring regardless,</p>
					<p>"Well then it should be <i>more</i> illegal."</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>More Illegal?</h3>
					<p>When we want stronger laws, we assess tougher penalties.</p>
					<p>Much effort has been expended exploring why this doesn't work.</p>
					<p>In a nutshell, rule-breakers don't expect to be caught.</p>
					<p>Some laws carry the death penalty (although not in Canada) and are still broken.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Selective Enforcement</h3>
					<p>Occurs when a rule isn't worth applying consistently.</p>
					<p>The moderators / enforcers become bullies by wielding rules against people they don't like.</p>
					<p>This is a strong sign that a rule (or system of rules) is invalid.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Cider House Rules</h3>
					<p>Occurs when the rules don't apply to the rule-makers.</p>
					<p>Such rules typically discriminate against a selective group of people.</p>
					<p>Consider that a panel comprised of men should not set rules about how women ought to act.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Regulatory Capture</h3>
					<p>Occurs when pioneers in an industry set rules that inhibit new competitors.</p>
					<p>Frequently happens when entrenched parties are the best practices experts.</p>
					<p>Consider that a Coding Standard which only applies to new code affects new hires disproportionately.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Fix Your Processes</h3>
					<p>Rather than punishing mistakes through rules, make it easier for people to do the right thing.</p>
					<p>Education helps, set people up for success.</p>
					<p>Recognize that some people don't see the harm in hurting others.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Living Documents</h3>
					<p>Like any documentation, rules are subject to addendums, rewrites, and obsolescense.</p>
					<p>Involve human judgement to guard against rules doing more harm than good.</p>
					<p>Plan for your rules to go out of date.</p>
